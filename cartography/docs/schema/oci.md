### Relationships
- Many node types belong to an `OCI Tenancy`.

	```
	(OCITenancy)-[RESOURCE]->(OCIUser,
                              OCIGroup,
                              OCICompartment)
	```
- An `OCIPolicy` node is defined for an `OCITenancy`.

	```
	(OCITenancy)-[OCI_POLICY]->(OCIPolicy)
	```

 ## OCICompartment

/ Field / Description /
/-------/-------------/
/ firstseen / Timestamp of when a sync job first discovered this node  /
/ lastupdated /  Timestamp of the last time the node was updated /
/ compartmentid / The compartment id of the compartment /
/ name / The friendly name of the compartment  /
/ description / The description the compartment /
